# Influencer Dashboard

![list design](./assets/influencer_list_design.png)

Written in React (and Redux), this demo uses an integrated dummy json-server to demonstrate API calls.

To run the application

a) Make sure that you're using the latest npm/node version and json-server
```
npm install -g json-server
```

b) Run the main application this way:
```
git clone https://github.com/mapleleafjack/Influencer Influencer
cd Influencer
npm install  #install dependencies
npm start
```

c) In another terminal, run the dummy JSON server
```
node server.js
```
